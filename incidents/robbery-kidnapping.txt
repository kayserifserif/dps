INCIDENT: ROBBERY/KIDNAPPING
ALERT #: 2018-002
REPORTED OFFENSE: As the victim (student) walked away from her residence near Normandie and 30th St., she was approached by the suspect who was riding an electric scooter. The suspect brandished a knife and demanded her money. Since the victim had no money, the suspect forced her to walk to a nearby ATM where he demanded she withdraw cash. When she was unable to do so, the suspect forced the victim to return to her residence where he demanded money. After obtaining a small amount of cash, the suspect fled in an unknown direction. The victim was not injured. The suspect in this incident appears to be the same suspect involved in an attempt robbery later in the afternoon at 37th St. and Vermont (Alert #2018-01).
