Incident description: At approximately 9:30 PM, a student was skateboarding in the 3500 block of Budlong Avenue when a vehicle pulled alongside of him and two suspects stepped out. One of the suspects brandished a knife and demanded the student’s property. The student complied and gave the suspect his property which included his wallet and his skateboard. The student was not injured. After completing the crime, the suspects sped away in a black Acura with tinted windows and “high density” headlamps. A short time later, the same suspects forcibly stole a white Nissan 4-door, license plate 4EML758, in the area of 29th Street and Walton (off campus).
Disposition: After a radio broadcast by USC DPS, an LAPD Rampart Division patrol officer observed the stolen vehicle in their area and a pursuit ensued. The stolen vehicle crashed at 1st Street and Hill Street and a 17 year old male was taken into custody. The student’s stolen property was found inside the vehicle. The second suspect involved in the robbery, described as a male Latino, has not been located.
