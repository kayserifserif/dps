Description of Incident: At approximately 1:20 p.m., a female student reported that a male suspect riding a black bicycle grabbed her buttocks as he rode past. While DPS officers searched the area for the suspect, two other reports of sexual battery with the same description as the prior incident were reported. At 2:39 p.m., a DPS surveillance camera operator told DPS officers that he saw the suspect riding southbound on Hoover Street. Additional DPS camera operators helped lead DPS officers to the suspect.
Incident Resolution: DPS officers detained the suspect at Adams Boulevard and 24th Street. An investigation revealed that the suspect matched the description of the suspect who was involved in several recent sexual batteries on or near the campus. The victims of the previous incidents later identified the suspect as the person who committed the offenses. The suspect was arrested and booked at LAPD for multiple incidents of sexual battery.
